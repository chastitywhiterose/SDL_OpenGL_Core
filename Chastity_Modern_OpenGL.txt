This file is my list of links and other resources to help me learn modern OpenGL. I'm good with the legacy fixed function pipeline and I tried to learn modern OpenGL years ago and gave up.

I'm not usually someone who gives up easily so as you can imagine this means that I found modern OpenGL to be extremely difficult compared to all my other programming projects. But nonetheless I shall continue in my quest to draw shapes using modern OpenGL. Not because I need it(SDL2 provides absolutely everything I need for my game development), but because I just want to finish what I started.

These are good sites although a little confusing for me.

To get the modern features of OpenGL loaded, it is necessary to use an OpenGL extension loading library. A lot of tutorials use GLEW.

Although learning modern OpenGL is useful in some cases, SDL already has a feature to draw arbitrary numbers of triangles with the new SDL_RenderGeometry. There is very little that it can't do. This is my primary means of doing filled polygons.
