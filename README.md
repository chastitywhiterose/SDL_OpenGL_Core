# SDL_OpenGL_Core
Using modern OpenGL in combination with SDL.

Legacy OpenGL is easy for me to use. However I never have mastered Modern OpenGL. There is not much here but this repository is my files I am using at I learn to use modern OpenGL. I have no real interest in it aside from doing my polygon demos but I very much want to master it because OpenGL is very cool and very fast. Since it can interact with any other media library, I'm sure this information will help me in game development.
